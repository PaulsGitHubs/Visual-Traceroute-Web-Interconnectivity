# Visual-Traceroute-Web-Interconnectivity

## Overview

In today's digitized world, internet security has become a pivotal concern. With rising incidents of data breaches and cyber attacks, it's more important than ever to understand the flow of our data over the internet. This project aims to provide insight into that flow by visualizing internet connectivity through traceroutes and packet sniffing.

Our tool is designed to work in tandem with an internet packet sniffing tool, allowing users to visualize the journey their data takes across the globe. This project emphasizes the importance of data transparency and aims to educate individuals on the significance of understanding where their data is retrieved from and where it is sent.

## Features

- **Traceroute Visualization**: Uncover the path that your data takes through the internet. See the servers that your data passes through before it reaches its destination.
- **Packet Sniffing**: Works hand-in-hand with packet sniffing tools to provide a detailed analysis of data packets being sent and received by your computer.
- **Data Flow Mapping**: Understand where your data is coming from and where it's going, promoting transparency and security.

## Future Work

This uses Scapy for packet capture and is not optimized for speed, I think it would be good to optimize for speed...
